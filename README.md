# Simple-sublinear-Fourier-sampling
This library of matlab code provides a very simple implementation of a sublinear Fourier sampling algorithm. This is not the fastest algorithm or implementation, nor is it the most sophisticated, but it is an example of a straightforward sublinear time algorithm. 

It is modeled on A. C. Gilbert ; S. Muthukrishnan and M. Strauss, "Improved time bounds for near-optimal sparse Fourier representations", Proc. SPIE 5914, Wavelets XI, 59141A (May 04, 2011); doi:10.1117/12.615931; http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.615931.
